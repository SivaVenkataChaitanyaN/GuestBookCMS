In abstract class, Abstract method can never be declared as private

In abstract class, If abstract method is declared as protected, In extended class it can be 
	declared as protected or public. (i.e Higher Visibility)
	
In overriding, It has be one with higher visibility - Overriding Rule

In interfaces, Interface functions can  be Overrided and overriding rule is still intact.

Same names for interfaces and classes is not possible.

Same names for variables and functions is possible.

Same names for variables and class names is possible.

		a0, a1 that give the least value for sum(ye - y)^2
